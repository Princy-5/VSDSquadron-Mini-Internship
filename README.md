# Conclusion
  By following these steps, you will have a virtual environment set up with the RISC-V toolchain ready for development. This setup allows you to compile and test RISC-V 
  programs, providing a robust environment for RISC-V development projects.


# TASK 2 
# PROJECT 1 - Ticket Terminal Designer: Developing an Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine
To develop an Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine using the RISC-V toolchain, we will create a simple program that simulates issuing parking tickets. The program will prompt the user for the number of hours they intend to park, calculate the total cost based on a predefined rate, and print a ticket with the details.
## 1. C PROGRAM CODE
```
#include <stdio.h>
#define RATE_PER_HOUR 5

void print_ticket(int hours, int cost) {
    printf("\n----------------------------\n");
    printf("    Parking Ticket\n");
    printf("----------------------------\n");
    printf("Hours Parked: %d\n", hours);
    printf("Total Cost: $%d\n", cost);
    printf("----------------------------\n");
    printf("Thank you for using our service!\n");
}
int main() {
    int hours;
    int total_cost;

    // Prompt the user for the number of hours they intend to park
    printf("Welcome to the Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine\n");
    printf("Please enter the number of hours you intend to park: ");
    scanf("%d", &hours);

    // Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = hours * RATE_PER_HOUR;

    // Print the ticket
    print_ticket(hours, total_cost);

    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Compile and Run the Program**
1. Create the Source File:
     Save the above code in a file named **ticketterminaldesigner.c**
2. Compile the Program:
     Use the RISC-V toolchain to compile the program. Make sure you have the RISC-V toolchain installed and properly set up.

   `
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o ticketterminaldesigner ticketterminaldesigner.c
   `
3. Run the Program
   To run the program, you need an emulator such as Spike or QEMU. Assuming you have Spike installed, you can run the program as follows:
   `
   spike pk parking_ticket_machine
`
This will prompt you to enter the number of hours, calculate the total cost, and print the parking ticket.

**Behavior: Manages the flow of the program and user interactions**

```
int main() {
    int hours;
    int total_cost;

    // Prompt the user for the number of hours they intend to park
    printf("Welcome to the Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine\n");
    printf("Please enter the number of hours you intend to park: ");
    scanf("%d", &hours);

    // Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = hours * RATE_PER_HOUR;

    // Print the ticket
    print_ticket(hours, total_cost);

    return 0;
}
```
This code serves as a foundational example of how an automated ticket vending system can be implemented in C. It can be further extended with additional features such as ticket validation, payment processing, and database integration for a more robust solution.
### EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
 * Header Inclusion: The program includes the `stdio.h` header for input/output operations.
 * Rate Definition: The `RATE_PER_HOUR` is defined as a constant value representing the cost per hour of parking.
 * Ticket Printing Function: The `print_ticket` function takes the number of hours and the total cost as arguments and prints the ticket.
 * Main Function:
     * Prompts the user for the number of hours they intend to park.
     * Calculates the total cost by multiplying the hours by the rate.
     * Calls the `print_ticket` function to print the ticket with the details.

This simple program demonstrates the basics of creating an automated ticket vending machine using the RISC-V toolchain.You can expand this program by adding more features such as handling invalid input, offering different parking rates, or integrating with a real hardware interface for a complete system.

# CONCLUSION

# TASK 3
# SPIKE simulation and verification with -O1 and -OFast along with running the RISK-V Objdump

   To further validate the functionality and performance of the Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine program, you can use SPIKE for simulation and verification, and also run the RISC-V `objdump` tool to inspect the compiled binary. Additionally, you can compile the program with different optimization levels (`-O1` and `-Ofast`) to observe the impact on performance and code size.
**Verification with Optimization Levels:**
   * Verify the program's behavior with two different levels of optimization:
   * `-O1`: This optimization level enables basic optimizations that improve performance without significantly increasing compilation time.
   * `ofast`: This level enables aggressive optimizations, potentially breaking strict standards compliance for maximum performance.
## Steps to Compile, Simulate, and Verify with SPIKE
 1. Compile with Different Optimization Levels:
     First, compile the program with the `-O1` optimization level:

    `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -o ticketterminaldesigner ticketterminaldesigner.c`

    Then, compile the program with the `-Ofast` optimization level:

     `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -o ticketterminaldesigner_Ofast ticketterminaldesigner.c`

       ![Screenshot 2024-06-27 201633](https://github.com/Princy-5/VSDSquadron-Mini-Internship/assets/173944414/02098558-a1da-4dbb-820f-7fa67228670e)

 I used an AI tool to generate the initial code for the Automated Parking Ticket Vending Machine. Afterward, I compiled the code using the RISC-V toolchain and employed the SPIKE simulator for debugging and verification. By compiling the code with different optimization levels (`-O1` and `-Ofast`) and using `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump` to inspect the generated machine code, I ensured the correctness and efficiency of the program.

**(DEBUG done here) command:**

   * `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d ticketterminaldesigner |less`

2. Spike simulation:
   * Running with spike
     `spike pk ticketterminaldesigner`

     ![Screenshot 2024-06-27 202029](https://github.com/Princy-5/VSDSquadron-Mini-Internship/assets/173944414/a0b558b4-be10-4ddb-8d87-cd9d5438df8d)

3. Generating and Inspecting Objdump:

   * To debug the spike we need this command `spike -d pk ticketterminaldesigner`
   * Then, by using the command `until pc 0 100b0`,which is the 1st line command of the main function the program counter runs from the 0 till the code 100b0
   * To find the contents of the code we need to use the command `reg 0 sp` in which we content of the 100b0 th line
   * To find the content in the next line just give `ENTER`
   * Initially the value of the sp is `0X0000003ffffffb40` then the next step the sp values get subtracted with the hexadecimal and we get `0X0000003ffffffb20`
   * Finally, by subtracting the both main function values we get the 3rd output as `0X000000ffffffb20`

**About RISC-V Instruction Type**

 RISC-V, is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA), categorizes its instructions into several types based on their formats and intended operations. These primary RISC-V instruction types are:

1. **R-type (Register-type)**:
   - These instructions operate on registers and typically involve arithmetic or logical operations between two source registers, storing the result in a destination register.
   - Example: add rd, rs1, rs2 (Addition)

2. **I-type (Immediate-type)**:
   - These instructions also operate on registers but include an immediate value (constant) as part of the operation. They are used for operations like immediate arithmetic, loads, and conditional branches.
   - Example: addi rd, rs1, imm (Add Immediate)

3. **S-type (Store-type)**:
   - These instructions store a value from a register into memory. They involve specifying a base address (in a register) and an offset to calculate the memory address.
   - Example: sw rs2, offset(rs1) (Store Word)

4. **B-type (Branch-type)**:
   - These instructions perform conditional branches based on comparisons between two registers. They determine whether to jump to a new address based on the result of the comparison.
   - Example: beq rs1, rs2, offset (Branch if Equal)

5. **U-type (Upper Immediate-type)**:
   - These instructions load a large immediate value (shifted left by 12 bits) into a register. They are used to set the upper bits of a register without affecting the lower bits.
   - Example: lui rd, imm (Load Upper Immediate)

6. **J-type (Jump-type)**:
   - These instructions perform unconditional jumps to a new address. They are typically used for procedure calls or long jumps within a program.
   - Example: jal rd, offset (Jump and Link)

Each of these instruction types has a specific format, opcode, and field layout in the instruction encoding, allowing RISC-V processors to efficiently execute a wide range of operations while maintaining simplicity and modularity in the instruction set architecture
